This script helps you take time lapse photos using a Mac's built in iSight camera.

It requires iSightCapture: http://www.intergalactic.de/pages/iSight.html

You might want to use GIFfun ( http://www.stone.com/GIFfun/ ) to turn the photos into an animated GIF, or ffmpeg ( http://www.ffmpeg.org/ )to turn them into a video.
